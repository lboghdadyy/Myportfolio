            Hello there, my name is Soufiane Baghdadi, and I am a software engineer. I completed two years of study at a private training center in my hometown between 2022 and 2024. During this period, I acquired several foundational skills that were further strengthened and expanded throughout my studies at 1337 Coding School (42 Network).

Over these two years, I developed strong problem-solving abilities and solid programming fundamentals. The technical skills I gained are detailed in the About Me section.

In addition, I completed a one-month internship at ORMVAT (Office Régional de Mise en Valeur Agricole du Tadla – Fkih Ben Salah). During this internship, I built a website using basic web development tools and applied my knowledge in a real-world professional environment.

At 1337 Coding School, I worked on multiple projects within the 42 curriculum, progressing up to the cub3D project and completing the corresponding circle. In my most recent internship, I focused on Laravel, where I learned backend development concepts and successfully built my PFE (Final Year Project) using this framework.
